This is a movie recommendation system, that is trained on a dataset from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_new">The Movie Database (TMDb)</a> <br/>
The inspiration was the IMDB Dataset challenge on Kaggle, however, it was removed due to some copyright issues. <br />
For the recommendation system, the following three approaches are employed: <br />

1: Demographic Filtering. This will recommend same movies to the audience with similar demographics <br /> 
2: Content Based Filtering. This will recommend movies based on the content that you like, watch, etc.<br />
3: Collaborative Filtering. This will provide a better recommendation, and will recommend movies that people with similar interests watch (similar actors, directors, etc) <br />
I want to improve it further, but haven't had the time for it yet!
